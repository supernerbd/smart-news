# smart-news

smart-news was created as part of the [Rich Media Web App Dev](http://igm.rit.edu/~acjvks/courses/2015-fall/330/syllabus.html) 
course at Rochester Institute of Technology. It was the third (and last) big project: 

>Your mission is to create a useful and visually-rich HTML5 application that "mashes up" 2 or more Web services (XML- or JSON-based), and showcases your mastery of modern Web technologies.

smart-news combines the Facebook Graph-Api with the Guardian API. The app determines the interests of a given user by her "Likes" on Facebook. The Guardian sections, the user is most 
likely to want to read are then shown inside the app.
The app has a [web version](https://people.rit.edu/bmp7101/330/smartnews/) as well as a [Facebook-App](https://apps.facebook.com/1676537059257348/) version.

The smart-news app is still in development mode and Facebook might block users who aren't registered as testers. Please write me to get a tester access.
